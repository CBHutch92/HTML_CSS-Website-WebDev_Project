# About the Website Project

# This website is a basic website but demonstrates my knowledge of basic HTML and CSS skills in Website development. I chose to do make this website about the Pokemon Yellow game and provide a simple guide for anyone who may be playing the game for the first time. The zip file includes my HTML and CSS source code as well as the images I used. I will leave the link for my website below. This was the final project for my Web Development course (ITEC 2380).
# I received an A for this project
